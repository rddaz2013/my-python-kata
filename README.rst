Disclaimer
----------

This is second fresh attempt to study Computer Algorithms and Data Structures by following the
[MIT Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb).

In this repository I'm using Python, in order to also gain some practice!

This is a set of conding exercises that I have done for testing my coding skills for 
interview preparation using Python.
I try to make them as good as possible but I take no responsibility for any problems 
or errors you may incur if you try to use them :)
