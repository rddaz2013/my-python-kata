Disclaimer
----------

This is second fresh attempt to study Computer Algorithms and Data Structures by following the
`MIT Course`_.

.. _MIT Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb

In this repository I'm using Python, in order to also gain some practice, like in Kata_ ! I try to make them as good as possible but I take no responsibility for any problems
or errors you may incur if you try to use them :)

Features
--------

Arrays and Matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Finding peaks in arrays`_, both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays.
* Merge of N arrays (lists)

.. _Finding peaks in arrays: ./docs/algorithms/FindPeak.md

Graphs
~~~~~~
* Graph (using adjacency lists for its implementation)
* Breadth-first Traversal (BFT)

Heap
~~~~
* MaxHeap and basic operations

Usage
-----

Open this project in Visual Studio Code with remote container extenstion and have fun :)
